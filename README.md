## About.

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities (e.g. MIT, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, etc.) that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate curriculum for Data Science, minus general education.

To build this curriculum I've consulted different sources which can be found in the ``References`` section at the end of this ``README`` page.

An important note, mathematics is very important to data science. Therefore, when researching what would be the best approaches and content/courses to learn mathematics and statistics following the philosophy of this curriculum, I came to the conclusion that it would be better to study statistics at a traditional institution, so the courses related to these subjects here are mostly for fixation and reinforcement purposes, along with great books that have been recommended to me.

In regards to the duration of this project, by my calculations, adding up the estimated hours of courses, projects, books, articles and other supplementary materials (that is not accounted for here), I believe that this whole curriculum should be around 4000 hours, so with a weekly effort of 20 hours it's possible to finish it in four years... look how cool, right?. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ ヽ(^◇^*)/

## Learning Goals.

My main focus is to learn the contents following this [roadmap here](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/), created by the AI expert guys. 

But here is an overview list of concepts and skills I want to learn by the end of this "degree":

- Programming (Python, R and Java);
- Databases, Business Intelligence and Data warehousing;
- Data Visualization and Presentation Skills;
- Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, CV and NLP).

This is just an overview, if you want more details I recommend reading the main curriculum, and if you want a complete guide take a look at the roadmap. They created a guide describing all the skills and concepts needed to become an expert in Data Science and/or AI, in a cohesive and intuitive way.

## How this Repository is Structured.

This repository is divided into five main sections, which contain the courses divided by themes, each section starts with an introduction, describing what my objectives are with those courses and my learning goals.

After that, we have a table with the courses, which are structured in an order of difficulty or themes, but the sections are not sequential, with the exception of the first, which is an introduction, and the last, which requires a deeper knowledge of statistics.

Regarding the courses table, it has the following structure:

Course/Specialization | offered by | Duration | Repository if any | Certificate Link
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
The name of the course with a link to it. | The name of the institution providing the course. | An estimate of the duration of the course. | Many of the courses have projects, here are the links to the repositories containing these projects. | A link to the course certificate, because yes.

After these five main sections we have a complementary section, which follows the same structure, and we end with a bibliography with links to books I used for consultation.

## Main Curriculum.

The main curriculum is divided into five sections: Fundamentals of Data Science, Mathematics, Computing and Programming, Databases and Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.

Section 01 focuses on the basics of the Data field, and what advantages the use of data can bring. Section 02 is intended to be a boost to my math studies, but with a greater focus on computational math and modeling. Section 03 is about learning to code, in addition to other computer science related topics. Section 04 is all about Databases and Big Data, it´s tools and applications. And lastly, Section 05 is focused on Artificial Intelligence, and is the longest part of this specialization.

Each section contains a brief introduction describing what I want to learn and which courses I have chosen to do so. After that we have a brief description of the courses, with some of the skills taught. Then we have a small table with a link to the courses, a link to some project or repository with my codes, and finally a link to a certificate if I received one.

For more details and information, visit each specific section.

After the main curriculum, I've added a section with books and other relevant bibliographies, and a section focused on soft skills and specific skills in some domains that I'm interested in.

Okay, so without further ado, let's get to work!

## Important Notes.

* The duration of the courses that I put here are estimates made by the platforms where they are offered.
* At the moment I am doing this graduation, so the verb tense of this ``readme`` is a little strange, sometimes in the past, sometimes in the future, as I do it I will reformat it to better report my experience.
* As for the books, my university has partnerships with a few platforms, like O'Reilly, as well as a very large library that's where I got almost all of these books.
