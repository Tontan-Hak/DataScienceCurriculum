## About.

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins University that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate curriculum for Data Science, minus general education.

To build this curriculum I've consulted different sources which can be found in the ``References`` section at the end of this ``README`` page.

An important note, data science is math, period. Therefore, when researching what would be the best approaches and content/courses to learn mathematics and statistics following the philosophy of this curriculum, I came to the conclusion that it would be better to study statistics at a traditional institution, so courses related to mathematics here are fixation and reinforcement courses, along with great books that have been recommended to me. And can be found at the end of this repository in a specific section.

By my estimates, adding up the estimated hours of courses, projects, books, articles and other supplementary materials (that is not accounted for here), I believe that this whole curriculum should be around 4000 hours, so with a weekly effort of 20 hours it's possible to finish it in four years... look how cool. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ ヽ(^◇^*)/

## Learning Goals.

My main focus is to learn the contents following this [roadmap here](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#data-science-roadmap), created by the AI expert guys. 

But here is an overview list of concepts and skills I want to learn by the end of this degree:

- Databases, Programming, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Munging, and Wrangling;
- Statistics, Visualization and Business Intelligence;
- Machine Learning, Methods, Use Cases and Tools;
- Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Architectures, Training, Tools, and Model optimization.

This is just an overview, if you want more details I recommend reading the main curriculum, and if you want a complete guide take a look at the roadmap. They created a guide describing all the skills and concepts needed to become an expert in Data Science and/or AI, in a cohesive and intuitive way.

So I recommend checking it out if you're interested.

## Main Curriculum.

This curriculum is divided into five sections: [Basics](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-01---basics), [Data Science](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-02---data-science), [Databases](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-03---databases), [Amazing tech & other cool stuff](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-04---amazing-tech--other-cool-stuff), and [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-05---artificial-intelligence)

Section 01 focuses on programming and learning what advantages the use of data can bring. Section 02 aims to develop a high-level overview of the field of data science itself, its applications, tools, and methodologies. Section 03 is all about Databases, and in Section 04 my goal is to supplement with some important concepts that I wanted to include and didn't know where to put. And lastly, Section 05 is focused on Artificial Intelligence, and is the longest part of this specialization.

Each section contains a brief introduction describing what I want to learn and which courses I have chosen to do so. After that we have a brief description of the course, with some of the skills taught. Then we have a small table with a link to the course, a link to some project or repository with my codes, and finally a link to a certificate if I received one.

For more details and information, visit each specific section.

Okay, so without further ado, let's get to work!

### Section 01 - Basics.

This first section has a very simple goal, to learn the basics of programming and statistical analysis, not necessarily in a deep way, but enough for me to know what I'm talking about, and more importantly, master these fundamentals to form a solid foundation.

My learning goals here are:

- Understand the basics of the data area, what are its methodologies and tools, and most importantly its applications and how this professional can generate value;
- Learn database basics like SQL vs NoSQL, Joins, ETL Basics, Data Format and more;
- Learn to code, variables, functions, data structure, composite structures, recursion, loops, and other important things.

At the end of this section my goal is to know what Data Science is and what it's for, know how to code programs with at least 1000 lines in python, know how to use SQL to write queries and manage tables and create reports.

And for that I chose the following courses.

##

This first specialization is offered by IBM through Coursera and consists of 9 courses and a final project totaling about 180 hours (estimated by Coursera).

This specialization aims to provide a high-level overview of the field of Data Science, teaching concepts ranging from Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebooks, SQL through IBM db2, and theoretical concepts of data application, machine learning, etc.

During the specialization I carried out six projects which can be found in the link to the repository in the table below, with a link to the course (not sponsored) and a link to my certificate of completion.

Course | Repository if any | Certificate
:-- | :--: | :--: 
[IBM - Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate_Projects) | [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/DM7GE3CAPYLW)

This was a very long specialization which took me about 5 months to finish investing a lot of time plus the extra research I had to do as I felt that the past content versus what was required in the projects is a little discrepant, but that motivates extra research, aside from the technical issues with labs using IBM tools, but overall it was well worth it.

The course promises to introduce beginners to the area, and show you what the opportunities are, where you should focus and what to learn. And I believe he does it very well, obviously I'm not an expert, far from it, but at least I know what I should learn and where to practice. No more questions on reddit about what to learn in data science.

Just to finish this description, here is a list of the technologies and concepts presented during this specialization with a link to the badge I received from IBM upon completion (which took a lot of work to get and I want everyone to see u.u):

``Artificial Intelligence``, ``Bokeh``, ``Classification``, ``Clustering``, ``Data Analysis``, ``Data Visualization``, ``Db2``, ``Folium``, ``Foursquare``, ``IBM Cloud``, ``Jupyter``, ``Machine Learning``, ``Matplotlib``, ``NumPy``, ``Pandas``, ``Python``, ``Recommender Systems``, ``Regression``, ``R``, ``Scikit-learn``, ``SciPy``, ``Seaborn``, ``SQL``, ``Watson Studio``.

##

Well, now that we know the basics, my goal is to dive into programming, in data science Python and R are used, but instead of learning these languages directly, I find it interesting to explore the fundamental concepts of programming before, I believe that not only it will be easier to learn Python and R, but I will also be a better programmer, not just someone who knows how to replicate code.

For this I chose these four courses offered by Princeton University, the first two cover the content of the book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach, while the other two (Algorithms, Part I and II) cover the fundamental concepts of... you'll never guess... Algorithms and Data structure.

All courses are taught in Java, and total about 230 hours of content, it's quite a lot...

Links to courses, repositories and possible certificates are in the table below.

Courses | Repositories if any | Certificates if any

[Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) | [Repository]() | ---
[Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) | [Repository]() | ---

List of concepts and technologies presented during the course:

``Conditionals``, ``Loops``, ``Arrays``, ``Input and Output``, ``Functions and Libraries``, ``Recursion``, ``Performance``, ``Abstract Data Types``, ``Creating Data Types``, ``Sorting and Searching``, ``Stacks and Queues``, ``Symbol Tables``, ``Turing Machines``, ``Intractability``, ``Von Neumann Machines``, ``Graphs``, ``Data Structure``, ``Sort Algorithms``, ``Data Compression``, etc. 

##

Now we can focus on Python and R. For this, I chose these two specializations.

Courses | Repository if any | Certificate

[Data Analysis with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/R-DataAnalysis) | ---
[Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python) | ---

And to top it off, this last specialization is focused on applied statistics using Python.

[Statistics with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/PythonStatistics) | ---

This first section has about 17 courses, totaling approximately +400 hours. After finishing this part I hope to be sharp in programming, and understand why data is cool. But on top of that, now I can start for real.

### Section 02 - Data Science.

Course | Repository if any | Certificate
:-- | :--: | :--: 
[Data Literacy Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-literacy) | --- | ---

Section two is an introduction to the area of data science and some tools used, my objective is to understand what data science is, where it is applied and what are their methodologies.

This first specialization offered by IBM has ten courses, with around 200 hours to complete. In addition to offering an excellent high-level overview of the field of Data Science, it also introduced some tools like ``Github``, ``Python``, and some libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib e etc.), ``Jupyter notebooks``, ``SQL``, and some more concepts like ``Machine Learning``, ``Deep Learning``.



This second specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University is a more “punk” version of the previous one, with a greater focus on math, especially statistics. This specialization is longer, with around 300 hours to complete, and among the skills taught are ``Data Manipulation``, ``R Programming``, ``Regression Analysis``, ``Cluster Analysis``, ``Data Cleansing``, ``Rstudio``, and etc.

Course | Repository if any | Certificate
:-- | :--: | :--: 
[Data Science by JHU](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScience-JHU) | ---

And to finish off the introduction, let's focus on the tools. The following two specializations have nine courses totaling about 230 total hours, focusing on Python for Data Science and SQL. 

The Applied Data Science with Python specialization is offered by the University of Michigan and teaches things like ``NLTK``, ``Python Text Mining``, ``Pandas``, ``Matplotlib``, ``Numpy``, ``Python Data Cleansing``, ``Data Virtualization``, ``Scikit-Learn``, and more.

While the Learn SQL Basics for Data Science specialization introduces concepts such as ``Apache Spark``, ``Delta Lake``, ``SQL``, ``A/B Testing``, ``Query String``, ``Predictive Analytics`` and a few more things.

Courses | Repository if any | Certificate
:-- | :--: | :--:
[Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/PythonAppliedDataScience) | ---
[Learn SQL Basics for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/SQLBasicsForDataScience) | ---

Wow, quite a lot, and this was just the introduction, by my count this beginning has about 750~800 hours of content. But that's about it, Data Science is a very demanding area, and I decided to go to another college just for the math.

But concluding the Section 02, my goal was to learn the basics of the field, its applications, and tools, and I believe that these courses, 29 in total, helped me with that.

So, let's go to section three. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

### Section 03 - Databases.

In this section, my goal was to dive deep into databases, but let's break it down.

First I decided to learn a little about algorithms, for that I chose these three courses offered by Princeton University with about 140 hours of ``Data Structure`` and ``Algorithms`` content.

Courses | Repository if any | Certificate
:-- | :--: | :--:


Now to the database.

In this first specialization, offered by the University of Colorado Boulder, with about 120 hours, you are taught about database design, database software fundamentals, and how to use Structured Query Language to work with databases.

Among the skills learned are: ``Database (DB) Design``, ``Data Warehousing``, ``NoSQL``, ``Database Administration,``, ``SQL``, ``Database (DBMS)``, ``Relational Models``, ``Normalization``, ``Entity–Relationship``, ``(E-R) Model``, ``Database Application``.

:-- | :--: | :--:
[Databases for Data Scientists](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/databases-for-data-scientists) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DatabasesForDataScientists) | ---

Now something more advanced.

This other specialization also offered by Colorado Boulder University, with more than 140 hours, is focused on professionals in the field, and focuses on more advanced tools and concepts such as: ``Pentaho``, ``Data Visualization (DataViz)``, ``Entity–Relationship (E-R) Model``, ``Extraction, Transformation And Loading (ETL)``, ``Data Integration``, ``Data Warehousing``, ``Materialized View``, ``Business Intelligence``.

:-- | :--: | :--:
[Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-warehousing) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataWarehousing-BI) | ---

Hope to be good at SQL after this. By my calculations this section has about 400 hours of content, look how cool. But the important thing is that we covered important concepts, and speaking of important concepts, let's move on to the next section that covers precisely important things that I didn't know where to put ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ

## Mathematics:

They say the hardest part in Data Science is math, but here's the fun part (for me), I'm a Bachelor of Civil Engineering and Statistics so I don't need to learn math for data science from scratch, isn't that amazing!

Therefore, my math studies will be more focused on computational applications, and courses for review.

## Important Notes.

* The duration of the courses that I put here are estimates made by the platforms where they are offered.
* At the moment I am doing this graduation, so the verb tense of this ``readme`` is a little strange, sometimes in the past, sometimes in the future, as I do it I will reformat it to better report my experience.
