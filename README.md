## About.

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins University that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate curriculum for Data Science, minus general education.

To build this curriculum I've consulted different sources which can be found in the ``References`` section at the end of this ``README`` page.

An important note, data science is math, period. Therefore, when researching what would be the best approaches and content/courses to learn mathematics and statistics following the philosophy of this curriculum, I came to the conclusion that it would be better to study statistics at a traditional institution, so courses related to mathematics here are fixation and reinforcement courses, along with great books that have been recommended to me. And can be found at the end of this repository in a specific section.

## Learning Goals.

My main focus is to learn the contents following this [roadmap here](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#data-science-roadmap), created by the AI expert guys. 

They created a guide outlining all the skills and concepts needed to become an expert in Data Science and/or AI, in a cohesive and intuitive way.
So I recommend checking it out if you're interested.

## Main Curriculum.

This curriculum is divided into five sections: [Basics](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-01---basics), [Data Science](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-02---data-science), [Databases](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-03---databases), [Amazing tech & other cool stuff](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-04---amazing-tech--other-cool-stuff), and [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScienceCurriculum#section-05---artificial-intelligence)

Section 01 focuses on programming and learning what advantages the use of data can bring. Section 02 aims to develop a high-level overview of the field of data science itself, its applications, tools, and methodologies. Section 03 is about Databases and in Section 04 my goal is to supplement with some important concepts that I wanted to include. And lastly, Section 05 is focused on Artificial Intelligence, and is the longest part of this specialization.

For more details and information, visit each specific section.

### Section 01 - Basics.

To start off on the right foot, I'll need a few things, first to understand what data is for, right?

Therefore, the first course (or specialization in this case) will be Data Literacy offered by Johns Hopkins through Coursera.

This specialization is intended for professionals seeking to develop a skill set for interpreting statistical results.  Through four courses and a capstone project, you will cover ``visualization``, ``Measurement Uncertainty``, ``Probability``, ``Statistical Hypothesis Testing``, ``Statistics``, ``Causal Inference``, ``Data Visualization (DataViz)``, ``Empirical Evidence``, ``Cross-Sectional Analysis``, ``Basic Descriptive Statistics``, ``Survey Design``, ``Statistical Analysis``.

Courses | Repository if any | Certificate

[Data Literacy](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-literacy) | --- | ---

The other thing I need is a programming language, actually two, Python and R. So let's learn them!

For that, I chose these three specializations, which total about 250 hours of content on Python and R.

Courses | Repository if any | Certificate
:-- | :--: | :--: 
[Data Analysis with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/R-DataAnalysis) | ---
[Python 3 Programming](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python) | ---
[Statistics with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/PythonStatistics) | ---

This first section has about 16 courses, totaling approximately +400 hours. After finishing this part I hope to be sharp in programming, and understand why data is cool. But on top of that, now I can start for real.

### Section 02 - Data Science.

Section two is an introduction to the area of data science and some tools used, my objective is to understand what data science is, where it is applied and what are their methodologies.

This first specialization offered by IBM has ten courses, with around 200 hours to complete. In addition to offering an excellent high-level overview of the field of Data Science, it also introduced some tools like ``Github``, ``Python``, and some libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib e etc.), ``Jupyter notebooks``, ``SQL``, and some more concepts like ``Machine Learning``, ``Deep Learning``.

It was a great introductory course. And below is the link to my certificate of completion, and also the link to the repository with the projects developed.

[IBM - Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate_Projects) | [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/DM7GE3CAPYLW)

This second specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University is a more “punk” version of the previous one, with a greater focus on math, especially statistics. This specialization is longer, with around 300 hours to complete, and among the skills taught are ``Data Manipulation``, ``R Programming``, ``Regression Analysis``, ``Cluster Analysis``, ``Data Cleansing``, ``Rstudio``, and etc.

:-- | :--: | :--: 
[Data Science by JHU](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataScience-JHU) | ---

And to finish off the introduction, let's focus on the tools. The following two specializations have nine courses totaling about 230 total hours, focusing on Python for Data Science and SQL. 

The Applied Data Science with Python specialization is offered by the University of Michigan and teaches things like ``NLTK``, ``Python Text Mining``, ``Pandas``, ``Matplotlib``, ``Numpy``, ``Python Data Cleansing``, ``Data Virtualization``, ``Scikit-Learn``, and more.

While the Learn SQL Basics for Data Science specialization introduces concepts such as ``Apache Spark``, ``Delta Lake``, ``SQL``, ``A/B Testing``, ``Query String``, ``Predictive Analytics`` and a few more things.

[Learn SQL Basics for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/SQLBasicsForDataScience) | ---

Wow, quite a lot, and this was just the introduction, by my count this beginning has about 750~800 hours of content. But that's about it, Data Science is a very demanding area, and I decided to go to another college just for the math.

But concluding the Section 02, my goal was to learn the basics of the field, its applications, and tools, and I believe that these courses, 29 in total, helped me with that.

So, let's go to section three. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

### Section 03 - Databases.

In this section, my goal was to dive deep into databases, but let's break it down.

First I decided to learn a little about algorithms, for that I chose these three courses offered by Princeton University with about 140 hours of ``Data Structure`` and ``Algorithms`` content.

[Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines) | [Repository]() | ---
[Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) | [Repository]() | ---
[Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) | [Repository]() | ---

Now to the database.

In this first specialization, offered by the University of Colorado Boulder, with about 120 hours, you are taught about database design, database software fundamentals, and how to use Structured Query Language to work with databases.

Among the skills learned are: ``Database (DB) Design``, ``Data Warehousing``, ``NoSQL``, ``Database Administration,``, ``SQL``, ``Database (DBMS)``, ``Relational Models``, ``Normalization``, ``Entity–Relationship``, ``(E-R) Model``, ``Database Application``.

[Databases for Data Scientists](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/databases-for-data-scientists) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DatabasesForDataScientists) | ---

Now something more advanced.

This other specialization also offered by Colorado Boulder University, with more than 140 hours, is focused on professionals in the field, and focuses on more advanced tools and concepts such as: ``Pentaho``, ``Data Visualization (DataViz)``, ``Entity–Relationship (E-R) Model``, ``Extraction, Transformation And Loading (ETL)``, ``Data Integration``, ``Data Warehousing``, ``Materialized View``, ``Business Intelligence``.

[Data Warehousing & BI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-warehousing) | [Repository](https://github.com/marcoshsq/DataWarehousing-BI) | ---

Hope to be good at SQL after this. By my calculations this section has about 400 hours of content, look how cool. But the important thing is that we covered important concepts, and speaking of important concepts, let's move on to the next section that covers precisely important things that I didn't know where to put ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ

## Mathematics:

They say the hardest part in Data Science is math, but here's the fun part (for me), I'm a Bachelor of Civil Engineering and Statistics so I don't need to learn math for data science from scratch, isn't that amazing!

Therefore, my math studies will be more focused on computational applications, and courses for review.
