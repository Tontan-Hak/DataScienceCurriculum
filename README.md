## About.

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins University that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate curriculum for Data Science, minus general education.

To build this curriculum I've consulted different sources which can be found in the ``References`` section at the end of this ``README`` page.

An important note, data science is math, period. Therefore, when researching what would be the best approaches and content/courses to learn mathematics and statistics following the philosophy of this curriculum, I came to the conclusion that it would be better to study statistics at a traditional institution, so courses related to mathematics here are fixation and reinforcement courses, along with great books that have been recommended to me.

By my estimates, adding up the estimated hours of courses, projects, books, articles and other supplementary materials (that is not accounted for here), I believe that this whole curriculum should be around 4000 hours, so with a weekly effort of 20 hours it's possible to finish it in four years... look how cool. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ ヽ(^◇^*)/

## Learning Goals.

My main focus is to learn the contents following this [roadmap here](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/), created by the AI expert guys. 

But here is an overview list of concepts and skills I want to learn by the end of this "degree":

- Programming (Python, R and Java);
- Databases, Business Intelligence and Data Analysis;
- Data Visualization and Presentation Skills;
- Inteligência Artificial (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, CV and NLP).

This is just an overview, if you want more details I recommend reading the main curriculum, and if you want a complete guide take a look at the roadmap. They created a guide describing all the skills and concepts needed to become an expert in Data Science and/or AI, in a cohesive and intuitive way.

<!--

And if you're still not convinced, here's a roadmap I made.

## Main Curriculum.

This curriculum is divided into five sections: Fundamentals of Data Science, Mathematics, Computing and Programming, Databases and Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.

Section 01 focuses on the basics of the Data field, and what advantages the use of data can bring. Section 02 is intended to be a boost to my math studies, but with a greater focus on computational math and modeling. Section 03 is about learning to code, in addition to other computer science related topics. Section 04 is all about Databases and Big Data, it´s tools and applications. And lastly, Section 05 is focused on Artificial Intelligence, and is the longest part of this specialization.

Each section contains a brief introduction describing what I want to learn and which courses I have chosen to do so. After that we have a brief description of the courses, with some of the skills taught. Then we have a small table with a link to the courses, a link to some project or repository with my codes, and finally a link to a certificate if I received one.

For more details and information, visit each specific section.

Okay, so without further ado, let's get to work!

### Section 03 - Databases and Big Data.

There's no secret here, the goal is to learn the famous Structured Query Language, that's all. I've had contact with SQL before in this curriculum, but here's to jump in and dive deep.

By the end of this section I hope to be more comfortable with SQL, I know that proficiency only comes with practice and I intend to do so, but at least a good theoretical foundation is my goal.

### Section 04 - Amazing tech & other cool stuff.

This section is funny, for the simple fact that here I put courses that cover important concepts, but I didn't know where to fit them in the curriculum. So we have this section that covers things like cloud and big data, my learning objectives here are:

- Learn to use BI tools for data visualization.;
- Deepen my knowledge of Big Data and NoSQL tools;
- Learn the fundamental concepts of Data Mining;
- And learn more about cloud computing, after all, everything is in the cloud!

By the end of this section, I hope to be comfortable with some of the technologies presented here, to understand concepts such as virtualization and scalable programs, and to know how to deal with large data sets.

### Section 05 - Artificial Intelligence.

And finally we arrived! Artificial intelligence.

I'm not going to lie, when I started this project I was just trying to learn some new skills to improve my resume and get a better job. But after starting to understand, seeing the finished projects and the possibilities of the area, I fell in love, and of all the possibilities, AI was the one that caught my attention the most. I liked it a lot, it has great career prospects, it has a lot of math and on top of that it's really cool!

This is the longest section, it has more than 1000 hours of courses alone, I'm not considering the books and articles, as well as other related courses that I took from here, but I intend to do outside. And it's the ultimate goal. Upon finishing these specializations I want to:

- Develop efficient Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms;
- Being able to develop AI applications (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Recommendation Systems, etc.);
- Getting to win competitions on Kaggle (hahaha, who knows :)).

Obviously I don't believe that I will become the master of AI with just a few online courses, there are a lot of courses, but there are people with PhD's in this area, so I think there's a lot to learn, that is, super exciting.

But every journey starts somewhere, and I believe that after studying not only these specializations but all the content available here, I'll be on a good path.

After all, have greatness in small beginnings!

## Mathematics:

They say the hardest part in Data Science is math, but here's the fun part (for me), I'm a Bachelor of Civil Engineering and Statistics so I don't need to learn math for data science from scratch, isn't that amazing!

Therefore, my math studies will be more focused on computational applications, and courses for review.

***The courses here are arranged in no particular order.***

## Important Notes.

* The duration of the courses that I put here are estimates made by the platforms where they are offered.
* At the moment I am doing this graduation, so the verb tense of this ``readme`` is a little strange, sometimes in the past, sometimes in the future, as I do it I will reformat it to better report my experience.
* As for the books, my university has partnerships with a few platforms, like O'Reilly, as well as a very large library that's where I got almost all of these books.
