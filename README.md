## About.

Welcome to the Data Science Undergraduate Curriculum, a list of free courses from renowned universities like MIT, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, and more. This curriculum is designed to meet the requirements of a Data Science degree program, excluding general education courses.

My intention for creating this project is that I want to learn data science and I saw that there is a lot of free and good content on the internet, so I did the research and organized it in the most coherent way I found.

Initially, I created this curriculum for myself, but if you want to use it too, just clone it and take the courses that are linked.

To build this curriculum I've consulted different sources which can be found in the ``References`` section at the end of this ``README`` page.

## Learning Goals.

My main focus is to learn the contents following this [roadmap here](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/), created by the AI expert guys. 

But here is an overview list of concepts and skills I want to learn by the end of this "degree":

1. Programming Proficiency:

	- Python: Python is the main language for manipulating, and implementing efficient data models, in addition to being the main tool for artificial intelligence, so it is the most explored language in this curriculum.
	- R: Proficiency in R for statistical analysis, data visualization, and exploration.
	- Java: The introductory computer science courses I include here are taught in Java. So we will learn this language too.

2. Databases, Business Intelligence, and Data Warehousing:

	- In-depth knowledge of database management systems, emphasizing both relational and non-relational databases.
	- Proficiency in Business Intelligence (BI) tools for effective data analysis and decision-making.
	- Understanding the intricacies of Data Warehousing to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets.

3. Data Visualization and Presentation Skills:

	- Mastery of data visualization tools such as Tableau and Matplotlib for conveying insights effectively.
	- Developing the art of storytelling through data, ensuring that complex findings are communicated in a comprehensible manner.

4. Artificial Intelligence:

	- Machine Learning: Comprehensive understanding and application of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling and pattern recognition.
	- Deep Learning: Delving into the depths of neural networks, exploring architectures and frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
	- Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP): Application of AI in image recognition, language understanding, and text analysis.

### Section 03 - Computing and Programming.

This section is about programming and development, the chosen courses initially aim to introduce the basic concepts of CC (Programming Logic, Algorithms, and Data Structure), after, which we have two sections focused on Python and R.

1. **Core Programming**
   - *Overview:* Develop an understanding of computing by learning applied programming logic, data structures, and algorithms.

2. **Programming for Data Science in Python**
   - *Overview:* Python is the main language used in data science, so this entire section is focused on learning Python, from the basics of the language to its more advanced applications, with a focus on data.

3. **Programming for Data Science in R**
   - *Overview:* R is the main language for statistical analysis, it is open source and has a huge community, and it is the second most used language to work with data, so we'll learn it too.

### Section 04 - Databases and Big Data.

Now that we have the code, the math, and the music. In this section the objective is to delve deeper into Databases, learning SQL and Data Warehousing, after that, we have three other courses focused on Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Data Mining.

For this section, I'll not write an overview of the courses, as I believe they are already self-explanatory.

## Important Notes.

* The duration of the courses that I put here are estimates made by the platforms where they are offered.
* At the moment I am doing this graduation, so the verb tense of this ``readme`` is a little strange, sometimes in the past, sometimes in the future, as I do it I'll reformat it to better report my experience.
* As for the books, my university has partnerships with a few platforms, like O'Reilly, as well as a very large library, that's where I got almost all of them.
