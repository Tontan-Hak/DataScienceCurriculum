### Section 05 - Artificial Intelligence.

And finally we arrived! Artificial intelligence.

I'm not going to lie, when I started this project I was just trying to learn some new skills to improve my resume and get a better job. But after starting to understand, seeing the finished projects and the possibilities of the area, I fell in love, and of all the possibilities, AI was the one that caught my attention the most. I liked it a lot, it has great career prospects, it has a lot of math and on top of that it's really cool!

This is the longest section, it has more than 1000 hours of courses alone, I'm not considering the books and articles, as well as other related courses that I took from here, but I intend to do outside. And it's the ultimate goal. Upon finishing these specializations I want to:

- Develop efficient Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms;
- Being able to develop AI applications (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Recommendation Systems, etc.);
- Getting to win competitions on Kaggle (hahaha, who knows :)).

Obviously I don't believe that I will become the master of AI with just a few online courses, there are a lot of courses, but there are people with PhD's in this area, so I think there's a lot to learn, that is, super exciting.

But every journey starts somewhere, and I believe that after studying not only these specializations but all the content available here, I'll be on a good path.

After all, have greatness in small beginnings!

## Mathematics:

They say the hardest part in Data Science is math, but here's the fun part (for me), I'm a Bachelor of Civil Engineering and Statistics so I don't need to learn math for data science from scratch, isn't that amazing!

Therefore, my math studies will be more focused on computational applications, and courses for review.

***The courses here are arranged in no particular order.***

## Important Notes.

* The duration of the courses that I put here are estimates made by the platforms where they are offered.
* At the moment I am doing this graduation, so the verb tense of this ``readme`` is a little strange, sometimes in the past, sometimes in the future, as I do it I will reformat it to better report my experience.
* As for the books, my university has partnerships with a few platforms, like O'Reilly, as well as a very large library that's where I got almost all of these books.
